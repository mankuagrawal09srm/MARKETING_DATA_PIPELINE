# Scalability & Performance Optimization

## Overview

This document outlines how the marketing data pipeline can scale to handle increased data volumes (e.g., 10x growth) and the performance optimizations implemented or planned to support this growth.

---

## Handling 10x Data Volume

- **Data Partitioning & Clustering:**  
  Using Snowflake clustering keys on critical columns (e.g., `customer_id`, `signup_date`) to improve query performance and reduce scan times on large datasets.

- **Incremental Loading:**  
  Instead of full reloads, implement incremental data ingestion based on timestamps or change data capture to reduce processing time and resource usage.

- **Parallel Processing:**  
  Partition data and process in parallel where possible. For example, multiple ingestion jobs can run concurrently for different data partitions.

- **Scaling Compute Resources:**  
  Increase Snowflake warehouse size dynamically based on data volume and query complexity.

- **Optimized SQL Queries:**  
  Refactor queries to minimize joins, use CTEs or materialized views where appropriate, and filter early.

- **Efficient Storage:**  
  Use Snowflake’s native capabilities for semi-structured data to avoid excessive flattening or processing in Python.

## Potential Future Improvements

- **Data Pruning and Archiving:**  
  Archive old data to cheaper storage to keep the warehouse performant(maybe apache iceberg).

- **Caching and Materialized Views:**  
  Cache frequent queries or build materialized views to improve dashboard/report performance.

## Summary

By combining Snowflake’s scalable compute, efficient data partitioning, incremental loading, and parallel orchestration, the pipeline can be improved to handle significant growth while maintaining reliability and performance.
